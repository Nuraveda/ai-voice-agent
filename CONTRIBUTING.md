# Contributing to AI voice Agent

Thanks for thinking about contributing. This agent is one of six in the open-source [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) marketing stack, and we welcome PRs that fit its scope: LiveKit-based voice AI for outbound + inbound phone calls with operator review of every campaign.

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — open an issue on either mirror (GitLab is primary; Codeberg syncs nightly). Include the integration involved (LiveKit / SIP-Twilio / Sarvam / OpenAI Realtime / Bolna / Retell), the action that failed, and any redacted log output.
- **New integrations** — adding a new provider? Match the existing adapter pattern. Anything that creates an external side effect must surface a proposal through the human-in-the-loop gate before it executes.
- **Pipeline improvements** — keep the proposal → approval → execute → audit chain intact. The HITL gate is the moat.
- **Documentation** — README clarifications, runnable examples, integration recipes.

## Before you open a PR

1. **Open an issue first** for anything beyond a one-line fix.
2. **Preserve the HITL gate.** Any new action must route through an approval surface (Discord by default; web inbox in the Mesh Pilot cockpit). No PRs that bypass it.
3. **Add tests** for new actions and state-machine nodes.
4. **Format + lint** before committing.
5. **One concern per PR.**
