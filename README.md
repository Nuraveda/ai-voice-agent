> **Part of the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) open-source 6-agent marketing stack.**
> LiveKit-based voice AI agent for outbound + inbound phone conversations — built originally for COD (cash-on-delivery) order-confirmation calls in India, but the architecture is generic.

Receives platform webhooks (Shopify orders, custom triggers), places outbound calls via SIP, runs a low-latency voice loop with pluggable LLM backends, and persists every call + turn for analytics, replay, and operator review.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nuraveda-lab/ai-voice-agent.git
# or: git clone https://codeberg.org/Nuraveda_lab/ai-voice-agent.git
cd ai-voice-agent

pnpm install
cp .env.example .env         # LiveKit + Shopify + SIP/Twilio + LLM provider keys
pnpm prisma migrate deploy

node src/server.js                       # HTTP webhook receiver
node src/livekit-agent.js start          # LiveKit agent worker
```

## What it does

- **Receive Shopify order webhooks** — when a new COD order lands, enqueue an outbound call task.
- **Place outbound calls via SIP/Twilio trunk** — LiveKit dispatches per-call jobs.
- **Run a voice loop with Sarvam / OpenAI Realtime / Bolna / Retell** — multiple LLM-voice backends supported, pluggable.
- **Tracks state in Postgres via Prisma** — every call attempt + turn is persisted for analytics + replay.
- **Outbound + inbound** — same agent code can answer inbound numbers.
- **Indian-language native** — Sarvam STT covers Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati and code-switching, where generic STT degrades.

## The HITL pattern (shared across the stack)

Call scripts, follow-up actions, and any outbound campaigns route through the operator's approval queue before a single number is dialled. The agent surfaces calls for review (transcripts, outcomes, do-not-call additions) rather than running fully autonomously. In the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) cockpit, the voice surface lives alongside ads / sales / social in one inbox.

## Layout

```
src/
  livekit-agent.js                # LiveKit agent main loop (one job per call)
  trigger-livekit-call.js         # webhook handler that enqueues outbound calls
  create-sip-trunk.mjs / create-twilio-trunk.mjs   # SIP setup helpers
  register-shopify-webhooks.mjs   # one-shot Shopify webhook registration
  setup-bolna-agent.mjs / setup-retell-agent.mjs   # vendor-specific config
  server.js                       # Express HTTP server (webhook receiver)
prisma/                           # Prisma schema + migrations
systemd/                          # systemd unit templates
```
